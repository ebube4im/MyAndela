Take A clime Challenge
This was our final challenge for the Udacity Google Andela Final Challenge. 
A Tic Tac Toe Android app written Iin Java and XML
The app basically has one Main Activity.
There are two modes: Play with another player. You can either select player X or O
Also I added a button to enable you play with the computer. Although my algoorithm was not 
so intelligient to make the computer learn your moves and even make moves to win, I believe more
improvements can be done to it.

After Andela has looked at it and approved it, then it should be open for contributions.
I intended to add the option where users can connect wirelessly to play the game and also share their scores on 
social media. 
All form of help is welcomed afer Andela review my Code.

I remain an aspiring ever learning Developer:
